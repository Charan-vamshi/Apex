# Apex - Field Force Integrity System

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Sales teams often face the challenge of "ghost visits" - falsified field visit records where salespeople claim to have visited shops without actually being there. This leads to:
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Inaccurate sales data
- Poor customer relationships
- Management trust issues

## 💡 Solution: The Triple-Lock Verification System

Apex prevents fraudulent visit records through three simultaneous verification mechanisms:

### 🔒 Lock #1: GPS Geofencing
- Validates the salesperson is within 50 meters of the shop's registered coordinates
- Prevents remote check-ins

### 🔒 Lock #2: Physical QR Code Scan
- Each shop has a unique QR code that must be scanned on-premises
- Prevents standing outside or using photos of QR codes

### 🔒 Lock #3: Server-Side Timestamp
- All timestamps generated by the server, not the device
- Prevents backdating or time manipulation

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Mobile App:**
- Flutter (Cross-platform iOS/Android)

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloudflare R2 for photo storage
- Oracle Cloud for additional compute (if needed)
